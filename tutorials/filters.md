Object that contains a list of filters for filtering data.
The properties in this object match the `schema[].type` property.
For example, if the schema for a given column was of the type `date`
the grid would look for a filter called `filters.date`
if a filter cannot be found for a given data type a warning will
be logged and the string/RegExp filter will be used.

    filters.number = function (value, filterFor) {
        if (!filterFor) { return true; }
        return value === filterFor;
    };
